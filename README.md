# JPCT-AE-Vuforia5
In this repository we use JPCT with Vuforia version 5 to render 3D images.

Some comments:
* Have to put a api key of vuforia in *SampleApplicationSession.java* in line near 347
* I only work with differents world, one per object. Maybe in other option i'll work with same world.
* Work with the Image Target example only, the application will have all but only this will work with JPCT
* We have to modify a bit *ImageTargets.java*. All hard work is in *ImageTargetRenderer.java*
* Comments will say what have to include.
